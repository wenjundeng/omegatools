Omega Tools
===========

Omega Tools is a collection of scripts useful for scientific writing with LaTeX
and gnuplot.  Omega Tools currently contains these tools:

+ **makedependlatex** -- Generate dependency file from latex source to include
in Makefile.
+ **makedependgp** -- Generate dependency file from gnuplot script to include
in Makefile.
+ **gpmp2latexmp** -- Process .mp file generated by gnuplot metapost terminal.
After processing, MetaPost will use LaTeX to process texts in the figure.

System requirement
------------------

Omega Tools requires a number of GNU utilities, such as bash, sed, paste, sort,
date, echo, rm, etc.  Typical installation of any major GNU/Linux distribution
has these utilities ready to use.

Note that BSD-like systems, e.g., FreeBSD and Apple Mac OS X, have these
utilities but they may be different from the GNU version.  Omega Tools has not
been tested with BSD version of these utilities.  You may want to install the
GNU version of them if you want to run Omega Tools on BSD-like systems.  On
Apple Mac OS X, GNU utilities can be installed through
[Fink](http://www.finkproject.org/) or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).

Installation
------------

Simply copy the omegatools directory to anywhere you like in your system, e.g.,
your home directory, or /opt.  Then add the omegatools directory to your PATH
environment variable.
